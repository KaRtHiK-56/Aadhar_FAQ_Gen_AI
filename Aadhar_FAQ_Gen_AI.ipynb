In such cases the operator should arrange to take\\nthe biometric data by moving the equipment close to the enrole.\\nIf the finger/iris of the applicant has a temporary damage and it is not possible to capture the biometric, the\\napplicant should come later once temporary damage is resolved.\\nCapture Biometrics - Facial Image, IRIS and Fingerprints for all the applicants above 5 years in age.\\nIn case of children who are below 5 years in age, only Facial Image and authentication by one of the\\nparent’s/legal guardian is to be captured.\\nGuidelines for Facial Image Capture\\nEnrolee Position: For capturing facial image, it is advisable for the operator to adjust the camera instead of\\nthe Enrole to position herself/himself at the right distance or in the right posture. Frontal pose needs to be\\ncaptured i.e. no head rotation or tilt. The applicant should be instructed to be seated properly with their back\\nupright and their face towards the camera.\\nFocus: The capture device should use auto focus and auto-capture functions. The output image should not\\nsuffer from motion blur, over or under exposure, unnatural colored lighting, and distortion.\\nExpression: Expression strongly affects the performance of automatic face recognition and also affects\\naccurate visual inspection by humans. It is strongly recommended that the face should be captured with\\nneutral (non-smiling) expression, teeth closed, and both eyes open and looking into the camera.\\nIllumination: Poor illumination has a high impact on the performance of face recognition. Proper and equally\\ndistributed lighting mechanism should be used such that there are no shadows over the face, no shadows in\\neye sockets, and no hot spots. No light exactly above the enrolee should be used since it can cause\\nshadows. Light should be diffused and placed in front of the enrolee so that there are no shadows under the\\neye.\\nEye Glasses: glasses should be taken off before taking the photograph.\\nAccessories: Use of accessories that cover any region of the face is not permitted. For example, women in\\npurdah would have to reveal the full face before the photograph is taken. Similarly women in Ghoonghat\\nwould have to clearly reveal the full face before the photograph can be captured. The head may remain\\ncovered but the full face contour should be visible.\\nFurther, accessories like turban/head gear are also allowed as religious/ traditional practices.\\nHowever, accessories like eye patches are allowed due to medical reasons. This would also mean an\\nexception needs to be recorded for Iris, because only one Iris can be captured.\\nOperators need to be trained to obtain the best possible face images that satisfy requirements. Even if the\\nquality flag is green but the Operator is able to judge that a better picture can be taken, then same should\\nbe attempted. However, it should be borne in mind that recapture should not become harassment for the\\napplicant.\\nFor children, it is acceptable that the child sits on parent’s laps, but it needs to be ensured that parent’s face\\nis not captured along with child’s face. The background may get rejected due to non white screen in case of\\nchildren but two faces should not get captured in one picture.\\nActionable feedback needs to be checked for captures that fail.
